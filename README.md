# Fall-Detection-System

This repository contains codes of a simple fall detection system on STM32-F103 microcontroller. 

**Status**: Work in progress. A simple thresholding based fall detection system has been implemented.

## Hardware Used:
- STM32 F103
- HC05 Bluetooth Module
- MPU 6050/9250 

## Future work:
- Using Complemetary filter for inertial measurement
- Writing firmware using STM's mbed so that we would be able to use RTOS
- Using DL to get better results
